2. Locate the `CollaborativeTodoApp.java` file
3. Run the application directly by clicking the play icon ‚ñ∂Ô∏è or using the run shortcut

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If you encounter `'javac' is not recognized` or `'java' is not recognized` errors, ensure Java is added to your system PATH
- For compilation errors, verify you're using a compatible Java version
- If the program doesn't start, check for any console error messages
