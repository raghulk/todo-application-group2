## Collaborative To-Do List Application
Overview: Create a command-line or GUI-based to-do list that supports multiple users. Each user can add, remove, or mark tasks as complete, and the application should allow tasks to be categorized and assigned to users.
Core Requirements:
Data storage for tasks and user-specific views of tasks.
Task categorization and status tracking (e.g., completed, pending).
Support for concurrency, so multiple users can access and edit tasks concurrently.
Language-specific feature examples:
Java: Use classes for users and tasks, demonstrate object oriented principles, and implement concurrency using threads.
JavaScript: Use asynchronous operations (like promises or async/await) to simulate concurrent access, and employ JSON for data storage.
