## Collaborative To-Do List Application
Overview: Create a command-line or GUI-based to-do list that supports multiple users. Each user can add, remove, or mark tasks as complete, and the application should allow tasks to be categorized and assigned to users.

Core Requirements:
Data storage for tasks and user-specific views of tasks.
Task categorization and status tracking (e.g., completed, pending).
Support for concurrency, so multiple users can access and edit tasks concurrently.


Language-specific feature examples:
## Java: Use classes for users and tasks, demonstrate object oriented principles, and implement concurrency using threads.
## JavaScript: Use asynchronous operations (like promises or async/await) to simulate concurrent access, and employ JSON for data storage.

## Project Deliverables
Friday: Initial Planning and Design

Application Design
Define the overall structure and features for each language implementation.
Break down the application into manageable components, noting any major differences expected between the languages.
Create a GitHub repository for your group.
Task Assignment
Assign specific roles to each group member, ensuring tasks are balanced and based on strengths and experience.
Timeline Creation
Establish a timeline for completing each application component, setting specific milestones for each day.
Documentation of Design
Document the application design and initial plans, outlining each feature and any anticipated language-specific challenges.


Saturday: Core Functionality Implementation

Core Functionality
Implement the core features for the application in both languages, ensuring basic functions and complete and operational by the end of the day.
Use of Language-specific features
Integrate language-specific features in each implementation such as unique data structures, concurrency mechanisms, or memory management approaches.
Code Quality
Write well-organized, readable code with clear comments, following best practices for each language.
Testing and Debugging
Conduct basic testing to verify that the application works as expected in both languages, identifying and resolving any significant bugs.


Sunday: Final Features, Documentation, and Presentation

Application Completion
Finish any remaining features and ensure the application is fully functional in both languages.
Documentation and Comparison Report
Complete a 2-3 page comparison report covering the differences in implementation between the two languages. Discuss challenges, unique features, syntax differences, and overall language experience. Reflect on the language differences including ease of use, performance, and how each language's characteristics influenced your approach.
Report must follow APA version 7 guidelines.
Presentation
Prepare and deliver a 5-10 minuted presentation showing the application in both languages. Include a walkthrough of main features and a comparison of the two implemenations.


## Final Submission


Each group must deliver the following:

1. Implementation in Two Languages:
Both applications should perform the same core functions, tailored to the assigned languages’ features.
Code must demonstrate language-specific features as specified.
Code must be stored in a collaborative GitHub repository. Add the link to your report.
2. Report (2-3) pages:
Explain the differences in implementing the application in the two languages, covering at least three language-specific features.
Describe how each language’s characteristics affected the design, performance, and readability of the application.
Include code snippets highlighting key differences.
3. Demonstration (5-7 minutes):
A live demonstration showing both implementations in action.
Include a brief overview of the application and walk through the main features in each language.
Submit the Powerpoint presentation
